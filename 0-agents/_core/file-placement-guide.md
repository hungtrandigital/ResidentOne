# File Placement Guide — AI-First Startup Factory (v1.0)

**Purpose:** Authoritative reference for where every file type should be placed. This prevents sprawl, maintains single source of truth, and ensures work-item traceability.

**Use this guide:** ALWAYS consult this before creating ANY new file. When in doubt, ask @docs-guardian.

---

## Core Principle: Update Existing → Create New (Only as Last Resort)

**Default behavior:**
1. ✅ Check if a **canonical file already exists** in the suggested location
2. ✅ If yes → **UPDATE it** instead of creating new file
3. ✅ If no → Create new file **only after consulting @docs-guardian**

**Canonical files** (single source of truth, always update):
- `1-ideas/market-research/summaries.md` — All market research findings
- `1-ideas/finance/initial-financing-plan.md` — All financial hypotheses
- `1-ideas/marketing/initial-go-to-market-plan.md` — All GTM hypotheses
- `1-ideas/features/summaries.md` — All feature ideas
- `2-product-foundation/2.1-product-overview.md` — Product vision & positioning
- `2-product-foundation/2.2-product-backlog/backlog.md` — All epics
- `4-marketing/personas.md` — Customer personas
- `4-marketing/go-to-market.md` — Final GTM strategy
- `5-financing/plans.md` — Final financial planning
- `8-governance/risk-register.md` — All risks
- `8-governance/decision-log.md` — All architectural decisions

| Content Type | Canonical Location | Action | Notes |
|--------------|-------------------|--------|-------|

#### Operations Guardrail
- Place all organizational docs (org chart, roles, responsibilities, hiring plans) under `6-operations/team/`.
- Do not place org docs at the root of `6-operations/`; use `team/` for structure-specific materials.

#### Folder Naming Conventions
- Use kebab-case for all folder and file names (e.g., `executive-docs`, `market-research`).
- Prefer kebab-case everywhere (e.g., `executive-docs`, `market-research`).
- Numeric prefixes are discouraged for `1-ideas/` categories; use clear names like `market-research/`, `features/`, `finance/`, `marketing/`, `product/`, `technical/`, `operations/`, `executive-docs/`.
- Avoid mixing numbered and non-numbered names arbitrarily. Keep canonical names consistent with `INDEX.md`.

---

### 9. Work-Item Traceability Metadata

**MANDATORY for ALL work items (epics, slices, tasks, bugs, plans):**

Every plan, task, bug, epic, and experiment MUST include YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
id: [DOMAIN]-[TYPE]-[SEQUENCE]       # E.g., PRD-EPIC-001, CODE-TASK-042, MKT-TASK-031
parent_id: [parent epic ID or -]      # E.g., PRD-EPIC-001 (for slices/tasks/bugs) or - (for epics)
related_ids: [comma-separated IDs]    # E.g., CODE-TASK-001, MKT-TASK-031 (cross-domain links)
phases: [ideas | plan | code | review | completed] # Current phase
owner: @[agent-name]                  # E.g., @product-strategist, @fullstack-engineer
folder: [relative path]               # E.g., 2-product-foundation/2.2-product-backlog/
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
status: [planned | active | in-progress | completed | blocked]
priority: [high | medium | low]
---
```

**Master index:** `3-technical/3.2-implementation/status/work-items-registry.md`

---

## Special Cases & Routing Rules

### When Content Could Go Multiple Places

| Scenario | Decision | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Feature idea + financial projections | Split: idea → `1-ideas/features/summaries.md`; finance → `1-ideas/finance/initial-financing-plan.md` | Subscription feature: idea in features, unit economics in financing-plan |
| Product spec + technical spec | Split: product → `2-product-foundation/requirements/[feature]/`; tech → `3-technical/3.1-system-foundation/architecture/` | Authentication feature: product requirements in `/requirements/user-auth/`, domain specs in `domain-specs.md` |
| Risk (product + technical) | Single entry in `8-governance/risk-register.md` with cross-domain tags | "API rate-limiting bug causes revenue impact" — one risk entry, tags [technical, revenue] |
| Timeline in planning | Include in plan file only if user explicitly requests; default is scope-based not time-based | Feature requirements focus on what + quality metrics, not deadlines |

---

## File Naming Conventions

### Documentation (Markdown)

| Content | Pattern | Example | Notes |
|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| Feature/epic | `[feature-name].md` or in `backlog.md` | `user-authentication.md` or `backlog.md` epic | Use backlog.md when possible |
| Business case | `business-case-[feature].md` | `business-case-user-auth.md` | Always kebab-case |
| Plan/slice | `[plan-name].md` with metadata | `payment-gateway-integration.md` | Must have YAML frontmatter |
| Report | kebab-case, descriptive | `competitor-analysis-2025-12.md` | Include date if dated; avoid generic "report.md" |
| Analysis | `[analysis-topic].md` | `tam-sam-som-analysis.md` | Descriptive, kebab-case |

### Code Files

| Language | Pattern | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| TypeScript/Frontend | PascalCase (components), camelCase (utilities) | `UserAuth.tsx`, `authService.ts` |
| Python/Backend | snake_case | `user_auth.py`, `database.py` |
| Tests | match source + `.test.` or `.spec.` | `UserAuth.test.tsx`, `user_auth_test.py` |
| Configuration | kebab-case or UPPERCASE | `.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml` |

## Checklist Before Creating New File

Before creating ANY new file, answer these questions:

- [ ] **Is there a canonical file?** (Check mapping above)
  - If YES → Update it instead ✅
  - If NO → Continue
- [ ] **Should this be in the defined structure?** (Check INDEX.md)
  - If NO → Discuss with @docs-guardian
  - If YES → Continue
- [ ] **Does the filename follow conventions?** (kebab-case, descriptive, not generic)
  - If NO → Rename before creating
  - If YES → Continue
- [ ] **Will this file link to work-item traceability?** (If it's a plan/task/bug)
  - If YES → Include metadata frontmatter
  - If NO → Continue
- [ ] **Have I consulted @docs-guardian?** (For new files not in canonical list)
  - If NO → Do it now before creating
  - If YES → Proceed ✅

---

## Integration with Work-Item Traceability System

**Every work item (epic, slice, task, bug) MUST:**
1. Have a unique ID (PRD-EPIC-001, CODE-TASK-042, etc.)
2. Declare parent_id (which epic it belongs to)
3. Have metadata frontmatter (owner, phases, status, priority)
4. Be registered in `3-technical/3.2-implementation/status/work-items-registry.md`
5. Link to related cross-domain items (marketing tasks for product epic, etc.)

**Placement rules:**
- Epics → `2-product-foundation/2.2-product-backlog/backlog.md`
- Slices → `3-technical/3.2-implementation/plans/active/[slice-name].md`
- Tasks → Respective domain folder + reference parent epic
- Bugs → In epic's "Known Issues" section + registry
- Plans → `3-technical/3.2-implementation/plans/` with metadata

---

## Enforcement

**Docs Guardian checks:**
- ✅ File placement follows this guide
- ✅ Filename follows conventions
- ✅ Canonical files are updated, not duplicated
- ✅ Work-item metadata is present (if applicable)
- ✅ Cross-references link correctly

**When in doubt:** Ask @docs-guardian. Better to ask than create sprawl.
