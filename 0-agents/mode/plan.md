# Plan Mode — AI-First Startup Factory

**Version:** v3.0  
**Purpose:** Define the scope, activities, and workflow for Plan Mode

## Overview

Plan Mode is the strategic planning phase where agents create detailed roadmaps, specifications, and architectural designs based on validated ideas. This mode focuses on translating validated concepts into actionable plans, requirements, and technical specifications without writing code.

**Key Principles:**
1. **Plan Mode uses different agent perspectives (POV) and skillsets** depending on the planning context. The agent must adopt the appropriate role and activate relevant skills to deliver the best quality and most detailed plans.
2. **Default Focus: Quality & Coverage Metrics** - Plans must prioritize quality standards, coverage metrics, success criteria, and completeness. Quality and coverage are the primary planning concerns.
3. **Timeline is Optional** - Timelines, schedules, deadlines, and milestones are **NOT included by default**. Only add timelines if the user explicitly requests them.

## When to Use Plan Mode

Use Plan Mode when:
- **Creating product roadmaps** - Prioritizing features, defining backlogs, quality metrics (timelines only if requested)
- **Writing requirements** - Creating PRDs, user stories, acceptance criteria, success metrics
- **Designing architecture** - Creating system architecture, domain models, API contracts, quality standards
- **Planning implementations** - Creating implementation plans, technical specifications, coverage criteria
- **Strategic planning** - Defining go-to-market strategies, marketing plans, financial projections, success metrics

**Note:** Plans focus on **quality and coverage metrics** by default. Timelines are only included if explicitly requested by the user.

## Core Activities

### 0. Determine Plan Type & Adopt Appropriate Agent POV (ALWAYS START HERE)

**Before starting any planning:**

1. **Read `shared/context/current-scope.md`** - Understand finalized scope and context
2. **Determine plan type** - What are you planning?
   - **Technical/Code Planning** - System architecture, domain specs, API contracts, infrastructure
   - **Product Planning** - Product roadmap, requirements, backlog, user stories
   - **Marketing Planning** - Go-to-market strategy, marketing channels, campaigns
   - **Financial Planning** - Financial projections, unit economics, funding plans
   - **Creative/Brand Planning** - Brand guidelines, creative direction, visual identity
   - **Mixed Planning** - Multiple areas (use multiple agent POVs sequentially)

3. **Adopt appropriate agent POV and activate relevant skills:**
   - **Technical Planning** → Adopt **@system-architecture** POV
     - Activate skills: `backend-development`, `databases`, `devops`, `planning`, `problem-solving`, `sequential-thinking`
     - Focus: Scalable architecture, domain modeling, API design, infrastructure
   - **Product Planning** → Adopt **@product-strategist** POV
     - Activate skills: `planning`, `research`, `problem-solving`, `sequential-thinking`
     - Focus: Product vision, requirements, backlog prioritization, user stories
   - **Marketing Planning** → Adopt **@marketing-expert** POV (with @product-strategist collaboration)
     - Activate skills: `research`, `planning`, `ai-multimodal` (for strategy), `sequential-thinking`
     - Focus: Go-to-market strategy, channels, campaigns, positioning
   - **Financial Planning** → Adopt **@business-analyst** POV
     - Activate skills: `planning`, `research`, `problem-solving`, `sequential-thinking`
     - Focus: Financial models, unit economics, projections, funding plans
   - **Creative/Brand Planning** → Adopt **@creative-director** POV
     - Activate skills: `frontend-design`, `ui-ux-pro-max`, `ui-styling`, `planning`
     - Focus: Brand guidelines, visual identity, creative direction

4. **For complex plans requiring multiple perspectives:**
   - **Sequential approach:** Plan one area at a time, switching agent POVs
   - **Example:** Product + Technical planning
     - First: Adopt @product-strategist POV → Create product requirements
     - Then: Adopt @system-architecture POV → Create technical architecture
   - **Collaborative approach:** Consider multiple perspectives when making decisions
   - **Document agent POV used** in orchestration handoff

5. **Verify scope aligns with planning** - Ensure you understand project type, audience, and goals
6. **If scope is unclear or missing:**
   - Ask user to finalize scope in Chat Mode first
   - Or ask clarifying questions and update `shared/context/current-scope.md` with user confirmation
7. **If planning reveals scope issues:**
   - Ask user about discrepancies
   - Update `shared/context/current-scope.md` with user confirmation

**Action:** Always determine plan type first, adopt appropriate agent POV, activate relevant skills, then plan according to the finalized context.

- **Transition to Execution Mode** without brand guidelines (for creative work)
- Skip requirement validation (all requirements must be clear and actionable)
- Create vague specifications ("make it better" → rejected)
- Make technical decisions without ADRs (for major changes)
- Skip backlog prioritization (use ICE/RICE/WSJF)
- Create requirements without success metrics
- **Skip quality and coverage metrics** - All plans MUST include quality standards and coverage requirements
- **Include timelines by default** - Timelines are optional, only include if user explicitly requests

## Output Locations

**Placement guardrails (anti-sprawl):**
- Default to updating the canonical file for the domain (marketing → `4-marketing/`, financing → `5-financing/`, product → `2-product-foundation/`, architecture → `3-technical/3.1-system-foundation/`).
- Do not place marketing or financing plans inside `3-technical/`.
- If you must create a new plan file, it must be:
  - In `3-technical/3.2-implementation/plans/active/` (or `plans/epics/`)
  - Listed in `3-technical/3.2-implementation/plans/README.md`
  - Moved to `completed/` when done

All Plan Mode outputs go to:
- **Product Planning:** `2-product-foundation/`
  - `2.1-product-overview.md` - Product vision and overview
  - `2.2-product-backlog/backlog.md` - Prioritized backlog
  - `requirements/[feature-name]/` - Detailed requirements
- **Technical Planning:** `3-technical/3.1-system-foundation/` (ALL REQUIRED)
  - `infrastructure.md` - Infrastructure design (cloud, scaling, cost, tech stack)
  - `design-standards/system-design.md` - System architecture with diagrams
  - `architecture/domain-specs.md` - Domain model (DDD)
  - `architecture/api-contracts/` - API contracts (OpenAPI, GraphQL, tRPC, etc.)
  - `design-standards/coding-standards.md` - Code quality standards and conventions
- **Implementation Plans:** `3-technical/3.2-implementation/plans/active/` or `plans/epics/[epic-name]/`
  - **Check existing first** - Review `plans/README.md` index before creating
  - **Add metadata** - Include status, type, priority, dates, epic, system
  - **Update index** - Add to `plans/README.md` Active Plans table
- **Marketing Plans:** `4-marketing/go-to-market.md`
- **Financial Plans:** `5-financing/plans.md`
- **ADRs:** `8-governance/decision-log.md`

## Mode Transition

Plan Mode typically transitions to:
- **Execution Mode** - When creative/strategic plans are ready (brand guidelines, marketing strategy, pitch deck outline)
- **Code Mode** - When technical plans are ready for implementation (ONLY after ALL technical documents are created)
- **Review Mode** - When plans need validation or quality check
- **Ideas Mode** - When plans reveal gaps that need research

**Before transitioning to Execution Mode:**
- ✅ Brand guidelines exist (for creative work)
- ✅ Marketing strategy is defined (for marketing deliverables)
- ✅ Product requirements are clear (for design work)
- ✅ Pitch deck outline exists (for pitch deck visuals)

**Before transitioning to Code Mode:**
- ✅ Verify ALL technical documents in `3-technical/3.1-system-foundation/` are created and populated
- ✅ If any document is missing, create it before transitioning

## Orchestration Handoff Format

When in Plan Mode, use this format:

```markdown
**Current mode**: plan  
**Task completed**: [Yes/No/Partial]  
**Plan Type**: [Technical/Product/Marketing/Financial/Creative/Mixed]
**Agent POV Used**: [@system-architecture / @product-strategist / @marketing-expert / @business-analyst / @creative-director]
