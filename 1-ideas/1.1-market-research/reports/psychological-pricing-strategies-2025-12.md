## Psychological Pricing Effects Applied

### 1. Anchoring Effect

#### Concept
Present a high "anchor" price first to make actual prices seem more attractive.

#### Application

##### Pricing Display Strategy
**Original Display:**
- Standard: VND 8M/month
- Premium: VND 15M/month
- Enterprise: VND 25M/month

**Anchored Display (Recommended):**
- ~~VND 15M/month~~ → **Standard: VND 8M/month** (47% savings!)
- ~~VND 25M/month~~ → **Premium: VND 15M/month** (40% savings!)
- ~~VND 35M/month~~ → **Enterprise: VND 25M/month** (29% savings!)

**Psychological Impact:**
- Customers see "savings" even though prices are the same
- Higher perceived value
- Increased conversion rate (estimated +15-25%)

##### Feature Anchoring
**Feature List Display:**
- Show "Premium Features" (VND 15M/month) first
- Then show "Standard Features" (VND 8M/month) as "Essential"
- Anchor: Premium features make Standard seem like great value

**Example:**
```
Premium Features (VND 15M/month):
✅ Unlimited listings
✅ Advanced analytics
✅ White-label branding
✅ API access
✅ Priority support

Standard Features (VND 8M/month):
✅ All essential features
✅ Unlimited listings
✅ Basic analytics
✅ Email support
```

##### Annual Pricing Anchor
**Monthly Display:**
- Monthly: VND 8M/month
- Annual: ~~VND 96M/year~~ → **VND 72M/year** (25% discount, save VND 24M!)

**Anchoring Effect:**
- Annual price anchored to monthly × 12
- Discount appears larger
- Encourages annual commitment

### 2. Scarcity Effect

#### Concept
Create urgency through limited availability, limited time, or limited quantity.

#### Application
