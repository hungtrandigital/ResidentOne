- **If revenue ramps as projected:** May not need additional funding
- **If revenue slower:** VND 1-2B to bridge to profitability
- **If revenue faster:** May not need additional funding, or use for faster expansion

### 10.2 Cost Optimization

**Immediate:**
- Consider deferring founder/co-founder salaries in early months (extend runway)
- Use equity-heavy compensation for founders/co-founders
- Start with minimal infrastructure, scale as needed
- Use community ambassador model to reduce CAC

**Short-term:**
- Hire onboarding team only when building acquisition ramps (Month 7+)
- Use revenue share partnerships to reduce CAC
- Optimize infrastructure costs (use VPS, scale gradually)

**Long-term:**
- Automate onboarding processes to reduce team size
- Build self-service tools to reduce support costs
- Optimize variable costs per building

### 10.3 Growth Strategy - AI-First
