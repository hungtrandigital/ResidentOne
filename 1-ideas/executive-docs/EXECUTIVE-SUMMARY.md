## 1. Executive Overview

### 1.1 Product Vision

**ResidentOne** is a resident-owned building community platform that serves as a comprehensive digital hub for each building in Vietnam. The platform combines building management support and marketplace functionality, following a strategic approach of **"Resident Support First → Commerce Enablement"**.

**Core Value Proposition:**
- **Resident-Owned:** Platform survives BQT/BQL changes with complete data continuity
- **Trust & Safety:** Verified residents, system-wide scam blocking, building-specific context
- **Comprehensive Hub:** Marketplace, announcements, surveys, service directory - all in one place

- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Users register once, access any building's app with same account

### 1.2 Strategic Approach

**Core Philosophy:** "Resident Support First → Commerce Enablement"

**Rationale:**
1. **Build Trust First:** Solve critical management pain points (BQT/BQL turnover, data loss) to build resident trust
2. **Create Daily Engagement:** Management features (notifications, polls, service directory) create daily platform use
3. **Enable Commerce on Foundation:** Trust and engagement from Phase 1 enable safe commerce in Phase 2
4. **Synergistic Value:** Management and commerce work together, reinforcing each other

**Phased Rollout:**
- **Phase 1 (Months 1-6):** Foundation - Resident Support (5-10 buildings)
- **Phase 2 (Months 4-12):** Commerce Enablement (20-50 buildings)
- **Phase 3 (Months 10-18):** Growth & Expansion (50-100 buildings)
