## 1. Team Structure & Compensation

### 1.1 AI-First Development Approach

**Development Strategy:**
- **AI Factory (Model-Agnostic):** Primary development work using any LLM with our rules-based framework
- **Process:** Read documentation → Code → Test → Fix → Review → Done
- **Quality Assurance:** Factory AI with precise rules ensures ship-fast and good-quality
- **Technical Lead Role:** Review process & code (not hands-on development)
- **Timeline:** 1-2 months planning/validation + 2 weeks coding = MVP ready Month 2-3
- **Model Independence:** Not dependent on any specific LLM - can use Claude, GPT, or any model that follows our rules

**Key Benefits:**
- Faster development (2-3 months vs 6 months)
- Lower team costs (reduced execution team)
- Higher quality (AI Factory with rules + Technical Lead review)
- Earlier MVP launch and revenue generation
- **Model flexibility:** Can switch LLMs without dependency risk

**Rationale:**
- Complete data isolation per building
- Ready for hand-over (dedicated infrastructure)
- Predictable cost per building
