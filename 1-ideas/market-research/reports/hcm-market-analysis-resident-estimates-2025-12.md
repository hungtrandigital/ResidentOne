## 2. Building Scale Analysis

### 2.1 Units per Building

**Research-Based Estimate:**
- **Range**: 800-1,200 căn hộ/building
- **Average**: 1,000 căn hộ/building
- **Rationale**: 
  - Large-scale projects (Vinhomes, Masteri, etc.) typically have 800-1,200 units per building complex
  - Market research indicates this range for major developments
  - User confirmed this range based on market reports

**Building Types:**
- **Large Complexes**: 1,000-1,200 units (Vinhomes, Masteri scale)
- **Medium Complexes**: 800-1,000 units
- **Smaller Complexes**: 500-800 units (less common in target market)

### 2.2 Housing Statistics

**National Averages (2024):**
- **Average Housing Area**: 26.6 m²/person (national average)
- **Apartment Area**: 21.1 m²/person (lower than standalone houses at 26.8 m²/person)
- **Implication**: Dense living conditions, high community interaction needs

**Household Size:**
- **People per Unit**: 2.5 người/căn (Vietnamese household average)
- **Rationale**: Typical Vietnamese family size in urban areas

### 2.3 Occupancy Rate

**Estimate: 85%**
- **Rationale**: 
  - Not all units are occupied (some investment properties, some vacant)
  - 85% is conservative estimate for active residential buildings
  - May vary by building type and location

## 3. Resident Calculations

### 3.1 Per Building Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Potential Users = Units × Occupancy Rate × People per Unit
```

**Calculation:**
- **Units**: 1,000 căn hộ (average)
- **Occupancy Rate**: 85%
- **People per Unit**: 2.5 người/căn
- **Result**: 1,000 × 0.85 × 2.5 = **~2,125 potential users/building**

### 3.2 Range Analysis

**Conservative (800 units):**
- 800 × 0.85 × 2.5 = **~1,700 users/building**

**Average (1,000 units):**
- 1,000 × 0.85 × 2.5 = **~2,125 users/building**

**Large (1,200 units):**
- 1,200 × 0.85 × 2.5 = **~2,550 users/building**

### 3.3 Active Users Estimate

**Platform Adoption:**
- **Total Potential**: ~2,125 users/building
- **Platform Adoption**: 30-50% (estimate based on MVP experience: 200-300 users from ~2,125 potential)
- **Active Users**: ~638 - 1,063 users/building (30-50% of potential)

**Daily Active Users (DAU):**
- **DAU Rate**: 20-30% of total users (as confirmed)
- **DAU per Building**: ~425 - 637 concurrent users (20-30% of ~2,125)

- **100 buildings**: 100 × 2,125 = **~212,500 users**

**Platform Users (30-50% adoption):**
- **50 buildings**: ~31,875 - 53,125 users
- **100 buildings**: ~63,750 - 106,250 users
