# Marketplace Digitalization Strategy

**Date:** 2025-12-12  
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-12  
**Research Type:** Product Strategy  
**Focus:** Digitalize Existing Activities, Don't Change Behavior

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategy for digitalizing existing buying/selling activities in building communities without changing user behavior. Focus is on improving experience through automation, categorization, and organization - NOT on adding payment or shopping cart features.

## Core Philosophy

### Digitalize, Don't Disrupt
- **Improve existing activities** - Make what users already do easier
- **Don't force new behaviors** - Don't require users to change how they buy/sell
- **Enhance current flow** - Better organization, search, and management
- **Familiar experience** - Similar to Facebook/Zalo groups, but better

### What We're NOT Doing (Now)
- ❌ **NO Payment Integration:** Payment happens offline (like current behavior)
- ❌ **NO Shopping Cart:** No shopping cart functionality
- ❌ **NO Checkout Process:** No checkout flow
- ❌ **NO Transaction Management:** Transactions happen offline
- ❌ **NO Behavior Change:** Users continue current payment/transaction behavior

### What We ARE Doing (Now)
- ✅ **Digitalize Posting:** Make posting listings easier and better organized
- ✅ **Categorization:** Auto-categorize or help categorize products
- ✅ **Search & Discovery:** Better search than Facebook/Zalo groups
- ✅ **Seller Management:** Tools to help sellers manage listings
- ✅ **Buyer Search:** Easy way to find products/services
- ✅ **Verification:** Verify sellers (trust)

## Current User Behavior (Facebook/Zalo Groups)

### Sellers (Current Flow)
1. Join Facebook/Zalo group
2. Post item/service with description and photos
3. Wait for buyers to contact
