- **Tier 4 (100 buildings):** VND 400M/month (VND 4M × 100)

### Strategy 4: Revenue Sharing Model

#### Concept
Share revenue with partners (developers, BQL companies) instead of charging upfront fees.

#### Revenue Sharing Structures

##### Model A: Fixed Revenue Share
**Structure:**
- Partner gets: 20-30% of building subscription revenue
- Platform gets: 70-80% of building subscription revenue

**Example:**
- Building subscription: VND 8M/month
- Partner share (25%): VND 2M/month
- Platform share (75%): VND 6M/month

**Target:** Property developers, BQL companies

**Pros:**
- No upfront cost for partner
- Aligned incentives (partner wants to grow)
- Lower barrier to entry

**Cons:**
- Lower revenue per building
- Need to track and share revenue
- Partner dependency

##### Model B: Performance-Based Revenue Share
**Structure:**
- Base share: 15% of building subscription
- Performance bonus: +5-15% based on performance metrics
- Total share: 20-30% of building subscription

**Performance Metrics:**
- User adoption rate (target: 30%+)
- Active listings (target: 50+)
- User engagement (target: 20%+ daily active users)
- Revenue growth (target: 10%+ month-over-month)

**Example:**
- Building subscription: VND 8M/month
- Base share (15%): VND 1.2M/month
- Performance bonus (10%): VND 0.8M/month
- Total partner share (25%): VND 2M/month
- Platform share (75%): VND 6M/month

**Target:** High-performing partners

##### Model C: Hybrid Revenue Share
**Structure:**
- Low upfront fee: VND 2-5M per building (one-time)
- Revenue share: 15-20% of building subscription
- Total: Lower upfront + ongoing revenue share

**Example:**
- Upfront fee: VND 3M per building (one-time)
- Revenue share (20%): VND 1.6M/month
- Platform share (80%): VND 6.4M/month

**Target:** Partners who want lower upfront cost

#### Revenue Sharing Calculator

**Scenario 1: Property Developer (10 buildings)**
- Building subscription: VND 8M/month per building
- Revenue share: 25%
- Partner share: VND 2M/month × 10 = VND 20M/month
- Platform share: VND 6M/month × 10 = VND 60M/month

**Scenario 2: BQL Company (50 buildings)**
- Building subscription: VND 5M/month per building (bulk discount)
- Revenue share: 20%
- Partner share: VND 1M/month × 50 = VND 50M/month
- Platform share: VND 4M/month × 50 = VND 200M/month

### Strategy 5: Performance-Based Pricing

#### Concept
Pricing based on performance metrics (user adoption, engagement, revenue, etc.).

#### Performance Metrics

##### Metric 1: User Adoption Rate
**Tiers:**
- <20% adoption: VND 10M/month (standard price)
- 20-40% adoption: VND 8M/month (20% discount)
- 40-60% adoption: VND 6M/month (40% discount)
- 60%+ adoption: VND 5M/month (50% discount)

**Rationale:** Higher adoption = more value = lower price per user

##### Metric 2: Active Listings
**Tiers:**
- <20 listings: VND 10M/month
- 20-50 listings: VND 8M/month
- 50-100 listings: VND 6M/month
- 100+ listings: VND 5M/month

**Rationale:** More listings = more value = lower price per listing

##### Metric 3: Revenue Generated
**Tiers:**
- <VND 10M/month revenue: VND 10M/month platform fee
- VND 10-50M/month revenue: VND 8M/month platform fee
- VND 50-100M/month revenue: VND 6M/month platform fee
- VND 100M+/month revenue: VND 5M/month platform fee

**Rationale:** Higher revenue = more value = lower price as % of revenue

#### Performance-Based Pricing Example

**Building A:**
- User adoption: 45%
- Active listings: 60
- Revenue generated: VND 30M/month
- Platform fee: VND 6M/month (based on adoption and listings)

**Building B:**
- User adoption: 25%
