# Product Overview: Building Marketplace Platform

**Date:** 2025-12-12  
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-12  
**Status:** Initial Product Vision

## Vision

Create a resident-owned building community hub platform that serves as the comprehensive digital center for each building in Vietnam. Each building has its own branded platform (e.g., "Chợ chung cư ABC") that starts with essential support services and enables transparent, safe, efficient commerce - all owned by residents, not management, surviving BQT elections and BQL changes with complete data continuity.

**Key Platform Characteristics:**
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Users register once, access any building's app with same account
- **Mobile-First:** Phone number-based authentication, native mobile app (iOS/Android)
- **System-Wide Trust & Safety:** If user scams in one building, blocked from all buildings
- **Comprehensive Hub:** Marketplace, announcements, surveys, service directory - all in one place

## Mission

Support residents first through essential building services (service directory, efficient communication, data continuity), then enable transparent, safe, and efficient commerce within the building community. Build trust through support, enable commerce on foundation - all while surviving management changes and maintaining complete data continuity.

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
1. **Building Residents (Cư Dân)** - Property owners living in building (buyers, sellers, information sharers)
2. **Renters (Người Thuê)** - People renting units in building (buyers, sellers, participants)
3. **Building Management (BQL)** - Operational management
4. **Building Board (BQT)** - Governance and resident satisfaction

**Note:** Both residents (owners) and renters are end users with full platform access.

### Secondary Users
5. **Property Owners** - Self-listing properties
6. **Local Businesses** - Service providers, restaurants, shops
7. **Real Estate Agents** - Verified agents operating in buildings

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
1. **Fragmentation:** Multiple Facebook/Zalo groups per building, hard to search
2. **Scams:** No verification, many scams on Facebook/Zalo groups
3. **Trust Issues:** Can't verify if sellers are actual residents
4. **Data Loss:** Building apps change with BQT/BQL changes, losing resident data
5. **Inefficient Management:** Manual notifications and polling are tiring/annoying
6. **No Organization:** Products scattered, no categories, hard to find

### Solution
White-label platform that:
- Consolidates all building activities in one place
- Verifies residents and sellers (trust & safety)
- Survives BQT elections and BQL changes (data continuity)
- Provides efficient management tools
- Organizes products with categories and search

## Differentiators & Competitive Advantage

1. **Platform Independence:** Survives BQT elections and BQL changes (critical differentiator)
2. **Data Continuity:** Resident data persists through management changes
3. **Trust & Verification:** Verified residents provide higher trust than general marketplaces
4. **Building-Specific:** Building-specific features and context
5. **White-Label:** Each building has own branded platform
6. **Multi-Industry Hub:** Comprehensive hub (retail, real estate, services)
