# Work-Item Registry — Master Index

**Purpose:** Central index of all work items (epics, slices, tasks, bugs, experiments, spikes) across all domains.  
**Location:** `3-technical/3.2-implementation/status/work-items-registry.md`  
**Update Frequency:** Updated when work items are created, updated, or completed.

This registry provides a single source of truth for tracking all work across the project, enabling traceability from any work item to its parent epic, related tasks, and cross-domain dependencies.
