## 2. Recommended Equity Distribution

### 2.1 Scenario Analysis

#### Scenario A: Equal Capital Investment (Recommended Starting Point)

**Assumptions:**
- All founders invest equal capital (e.g., VND 200M each = VND 600M total)
- Hưng gets premium for idea + MVP validation
- Tuyền & Yad get premium for bringing in marketing/strategy expertise

**Distribution:**
- **Hưng:** 50-55% (idea premium + MVP validation + tech resources)
- **Tuyền:** 20-25% (marketing expertise + resources)
- **Yad:** 20-25% (finance/strategy expertise + resources)
- **Ngân:** 5-10% (early employee, technical lead)
- **Option Pool:** 10-15% (future employees)

**Rationale:**
- Hưng: Original idea + MVP validation + tech resources = significant premium
- Tuyền & Yad: Equal split (both bring similar value - marketing vs. finance/strategy)
- Ngân: Early employee level (not co-founder, but critical technical role)

#### Scenario B: Unequal Capital Investment

**If Capital Investment Differs:**
- Base equity from Scenario A
- Additional equity based on capital contribution:
  - Formula: Additional % = (Individual Investment / Total Investment) × 20%
  - Example: If Hưng invests VND 400M, Tuyền & Yad invest VND 100M each:
    - Hưng: +13.3% (400M/600M × 20%)
    - Tuyền: +3.3% (100M/600M × 20%)
    - Yad: +3.3% (100M/600M × 20%)

#### Scenario C: No Capital Investment (Pure Equity)

**If No Capital Investment:**
- **Hưng:** 55-60% (idea + MVP + tech resources)
- **Tuyền:** 20-22% (marketing expertise)
- **Yad:** 18-20% (finance/strategy expertise)
- **Ngân:** 5-10% (early employee)
- **Option Pool:** 10-15%
