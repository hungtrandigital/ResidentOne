## Question

Should we invite a Building Onboarding Specialist with equity from the start, or have founders handle onboarding together?

## Option 1: Invite Building Onboarding Specialist with Equity (Early Co-Founder)

### 1.1 Structure

**Role:** Building Onboarding Specialist / Co-Founder
- **Equity:** 5-10% (early co-founder level)
- **Vesting:** 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff
- **Start:** Month 1-2 (from beginning)
- **Compensation:** Equity-only initially, can add salary later if needed

### 1.2 Pros

**Advantages:**
1. **Dedicated Focus:**
   - Full-time focus on building acquisition and onboarding
   - Professional, consistent approach
   - Can scale faster

2. **Early Start:**
   - Start building relationships from Month 1
   - Can prepare materials, processes early
   - Ready when first buildings are ready (Month 3-4)

3. **Higher Commitment:**
   - Equity ownership = higher commitment
   - Long-term thinking
   - Aligned incentives

4. **Founders Can Focus:**
   - Hưng: Focus on product, tech coordination
   - Tuyền: Focus on marketing strategy
   - Yad: Focus on finance & strategy
   - Not distracted by operational tasks

5. **Professional Approach:**
   - Dedicated person = more professional
   - Better customer experience
   - Can develop expertise faster

6. **Scalability:**
   - Can train others later
   - Can build processes and playbooks
   - Foundation for scaling

### 1.3 Cons

**Disadvantages:**
1. **Equity Dilution:**
   - 5-10% equity goes to onboarding person
   - Reduces equity for founders and option pool
   - Need to adjust equity structure

2. **Early Commitment:**
   - Committing equity before validating fit
   - Risk if person doesn't work out
   - Harder to replace if issues arise

3. **Cost:**
   - Equity is valuable (even if no cash cost)
   - Could use equity for other key hires
   - Opportunity cost

4. **Timing Risk:**
   - May not have enough work initially (Month 1-2)
   - Could be idle time
   - May need to do other tasks initially

### 1.4 Equity Impact

**If Add 5-10% for Onboarding Specialist:**

**Option A: Dilute All Founders Equally**
- Hưng: 52-55% → 47-50% (if 10% dilution)
- Tuyền: 24-25% → 21.6-22.5%
- Yad: 24-25% → 21.6-22.5%
- Ngân: 5-8% → 4.5-7.2%
- Onboarding: 5-10%
- Option Pool: 10-15% → 9-13.5%

**Option B: Reduce Option Pool**
- Hưng: 52-55% (unchanged)
- Tuyền: 24-25% (unchanged)
- Yad: 24-25% (unchanged)
- Ngân: 5-8% (unchanged)
- Onboarding: 5-10%
- Option Pool: 10-15% → 5-10%

**Recommendation:** Option B (reduce option pool) - founders keep their equity

## Recommendation: Hybrid Approach

### 4.1 Recommended Strategy

**Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Founders Team Approach**
- **Hưng:** Lead onboarding (CEO, product vision)
- **Tuyền:** Support with marketing materials, positioning
- **Yad:** Support with financial discussions, contracts
- **Goal:** Onboard first 1-3 buildings
- **Outcome:** Learn, refine, build processes

**Phase 2 (Month 3-4): Evaluate**
- **Assess:**
  - Is onboarding taking too much founder time?
  - Are founders stretched too thin?
  - Is quality suffering?
  - Do we need dedicated person to scale?

**Decision Point:**
- **If YES (need dedicated person):**
  - Invite Building Onboarding Specialist with equity (5-8%)
  - Start Month 4
  - Founders transition to strategic support
- **If NO (founders can handle):**
  - Continue founders approach
  - Hire later (Month 7+) when scaling to 20+ buildings
  - Hire with salary (not equity)

### 4.2 Equity Structure if Invite Early (Month 4)

**If Add 5-8% for Onboarding Specialist:**

| Person | Original | Adjusted | Change |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Hưng** | 52-55% | 52-55% | No change |
| **Tuyền** | 24-25% | 24-25% | No change |
| **Yad** | 24-25% | 24-25% | No change |
| **Ngân** | 5-8% | 5-8% | No change |
| **Onboarding** | 0% | 5-8% | +5-8% |
| **Option Pool** | 10-15% | 5-10% | -5% |

**Source of Equity:** Reduce option pool (not dilute founders)

### 4.3 If Hire Later (Month 7+)

**Hire with Salary (Not Equity):**
- **Compensation:** VND 12-18M/month
- **Equity:** 0% (or minimal 0.5-1% if exceptional)
- **Rationale:** 
  - Operational role, not strategic
  - Can hire multiple people
  - Less equity cost
