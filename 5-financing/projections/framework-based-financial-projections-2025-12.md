## 2. Revised Unit Economics (Framework-Based)

### 2.1 Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Framework:** Industry standard CAC = 10-20% of LTV for healthy SaaS

**Direct Sales:**
- Sales team: VND 15-25M/month per person (base + commission)
- Marketing: VND 5-10M/month (tools, campaigns)
- Sales capacity: 2-5 buildings per salesperson per month
- **CAC: VND 8-15M per building**

  - Marketing allocation: VND 2-5M per building
  - Overhead: VND 2-3M per building

**Partner Sales:**
- Partner acquisition: VND 5-10M per partner
- Buildings per partner: 5-10 buildings (Year 1 realistic)
- Partner support: VND 1-2M/month per partner
- **CAC: VND 2-5M per building**
  - Partner acquisition: VND 1-2M per building
  - Support: VND 200K-400K per building
  - Overhead: VND 800K-2.6M per building

**Community Ambassador:**
- Commission/reward: VND 500K-1M per building
- Support and training: VND 200K-500K per building
- **CAC: VND 1-2M per building**
  - Commission: VND 500K-1M
  - Support: VND 200K-500K
  - Overhead: VND 300K-500K

**Loss Leader:**
- Free period cost: VND 24M per building (3 months × VND 8M)
- Conversion rate: 40-60% (realistic, not 60-80%)
- **CAC: VND 40-60M per building**
  - Free period: VND 24M
  - Conversion cost: VND 16-36M (60% conversion = VND 40M, 40% = VND 60M)

### 2.2 Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Framework:** LTV = (Monthly Revenue × Gross Margin × Average Lifetime)

**Assumptions:**
- Monthly revenue: VND 8M/building
- Gross margin: 52% (VND 4.15M/building/month contribution margin)
- Average lifetime: Based on churn rate

**LTV Calculation by Churn Rate:**

**Conservative (5% monthly churn):**
- Average lifetime: 1 / 0.05 = 20 months
- LTV: 20 months × VND 4.15M = **VND 83M per building**

**Realistic (3-4% monthly churn):**
- Average lifetime: 1 / 0.035 = 28.6 months (use 28 months)
- LTV: 28 months × VND 4.15M = **VND 116M per building**

**Optimistic (2-3% monthly churn):**
- Average lifetime: 1 / 0.025 = 40 months
- LTV: 40 months × VND 4.15M = **VND 166M per building**

**Recommended LTV:**
- **Conservative:** VND 80M per building
- **Realistic:** VND 100M per building (average of scenarios)
- **Optimistic:** VND 120M per building

### 2.3 LTV/CAC Ratio

**Framework:** Industry benchmarks
- Healthy SaaS: 3-5×
- Excellent SaaS: 5-10×
- Exceptional SaaS: 10-20× (rare)

- **LTV/CAC: 10×** ✅ (Excellent, but realistic)

**Partner Sales:**
- CAC: VND 3M
- LTV: VND 100M
- **LTV/CAC: 33×** ✅ (Exceptional, but achievable with good partners)

**Community Ambassador:**
- CAC: VND 1.5M
- LTV: VND 100M
- **LTV/CAC: 67×** ✅ (Exceptional, but limited scale)

**Loss Leader:**
- CAC: VND 50M
- LTV: VND 100M
- **LTV/CAC: 2×** ⚠️ (Below healthy threshold, but acceptable for conversion)

### 2.4 Payback Period

**Framework:** Industry benchmarks
- Healthy SaaS: 6-12 months
- Excellent SaaS: 3-6 months
- Exceptional SaaS: <3 months (rare)
