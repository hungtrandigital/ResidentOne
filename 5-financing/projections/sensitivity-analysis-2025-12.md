Sensitivity analysis shows that **pricing and CAC** have the largest impact on financial projections, followed by **churn and conversion**. Growth rate has the smallest impact.

**Key Takeaways:**
- ✅ Pricing optimization is critical (largest impact)
- ✅ CAC optimization is important (significant impact)
- ✅ Churn reduction is important (significant impact)
- ⚠️ Need to monitor all variables closely
- ⚠️ Worst case requires +VND 470M additional funding

**Recommendation:** Use sensitivity analysis to:
1. Identify key risks (pricing, CAC, churn)
2. Prioritize optimization efforts
3. Plan for different scenarios
4. Set up monitoring and early warning systems
