**Scenario: Onboarding 3 Buildings Simultaneously**

**Week 1:**
- Building A: Pre-Onboarding
- Building B: Pre-Onboarding
- Building C: Pre-Onboarding

**Week 2:**
- Building A: Technical Setup
- Building B: Technical Setup
- Building C: Technical Setup

**Week 3:**
- Building A: Data Collection
- Building B: Data Collection
- Building C: Technical Setup (if delayed)

**Week 4:**
- Building A: Training & Testing
- Building B: Data Collection
- Building C: Data Collection

**Week 5:**
- Building A: Launch Preparation
- Building B: Training & Testing
- Building C: Data Collection

**Week 6:**
- Building A: Launch
- Building B: Launch Preparation
- Building C: Training & Testing

**Result:** 3 buildings launched in 6 weeks (vs. 12-18 weeks sequential)
