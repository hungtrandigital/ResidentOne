## 2. Critical Gaps Analysis

### 2.1 Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-6)

#### ❌ CRITICAL GAP: Building Onboarding Specialist

**Why Critical:**
- First buildings need professional onboarding (Month 3-4)
- Critical for customer success and retention
- Cannot be done by founders (they're part-time, focused on strategy)
- Cannot be done by tech team (different skill set)

**Requirements:**
- **Skills:** Sales, customer success, relationship building, building management knowledge
- **Experience:** B2B sales, customer onboarding, real estate/building industry knowledge (preferred)
- **Time:** Part-time initially (Month 3-4), full-time when scaling (Month 7+)
- **Compensation Options:**
  1. **Equity-based invitation** (preferred for Month 3-6)
     - Experienced person who can work part-time
     - Higher equity value potential (early stage)
     - Lower cash burn
  2. **Hire part-time** (VND 12-15M/month)
     - If equity-based invitation not available
     - Need guaranteed income

**Recommendation:** 
- **Priority: HIGH**
- **Timeline: Month 2-3** (start recruiting, onboard by Month 3-4)
- **Preferred:** Equity-based invitation (experienced person, part-time initially)
- **Fallback:** Hire part-time if equity-based not available

#### ⚠️ MODERATE GAP: Customer Support

     - Lower cost, more efficient for small scale
  2. **Equity-based invitation** (if separate person needed)
     - Experienced person who can work part-time
  3. **Hire part-time** (VND 10-12M/month)
