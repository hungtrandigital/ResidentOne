## 2. Critical Gaps Analysis

### 2.1 Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-6)

#### ❌ CRITICAL GAP: Building Onboarding Specialist

**Why Critical:**
- First buildings need professional onboarding (Month 3-4)
- Critical for customer success and retention
- Cannot be done by founders (part-time, strategic focus)
- Cannot be done by tech team (different skill set)

**Requirements:**
- **Skills:** Sales, customer success, relationship building, building management knowledge
- **Experience:** B2B sales, customer onboarding, real estate/building industry (preferred)
- **Time:** Part-time initially (Month 3-4), full-time when scaling (Month 7+)
- **Compensation Options:**
  1. **Equity-based invitation** (preferred for Month 3-6)
     - Experienced person who can work part-time
     - Higher equity value potential (early stage)
     - Lower cash burn
  2. **Hire part-time** (VND 12-15M/month)
     - If equity-based invitation not available
     - Need guaranteed income

**Recommendation:**
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Timeline:** Start recruiting Month 1-2, onboard Month 3-4
- **Preferred:** Equity-based invitation (experienced person, part-time initially)
- **Fallback:** Hire part-time if equity-based not available
- **Cost Impact:** VND 0M (equity) or VND 12-15M/month (hire)

#### ⚠️ MODERATE GAP: Customer Support

     - Same person handles both onboarding and support
     - Lower cost, more efficient for small scale
  2. **Equity-based invitation** (if separate person needed)
  3. **Hire part-time** (VND 10-12M/month)

**Recommendation:**
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Timeline:** Month 3-4 (can start with Building Onboarding person)
- **Preferred:** Shared with Building Onboarding initially (Month 4-6)
- **Separate hire:** Month 7+ when scaling (if needed)
- **Cost Impact:** VND 0M (shared) or VND 10-12M/month (separate)
